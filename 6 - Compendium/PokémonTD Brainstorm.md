# Concept
Tower defense with character level-up similar to Bloons TD 6. Baby/weak Pokémon are level 1, stage-1 are level 2, and stage-2 are level 3. 

# Characters


#### Status effects
- **Sleep** should be one of the most OP effects, so it should only be applied occasionally. Grass types could use spore, psychic types could use hypnosis.
#### Interactions
- Sleep + Gengar or other ghosts, can use hex to insta kill enemies
