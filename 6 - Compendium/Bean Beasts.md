Recently I played the game Bean Beasts, it tries to incorporate monster taming into a tower defense game. The game is as enjoyable as any other TD game, but to be honest, this game has nothing to do with monster taming.

Beans Beasts is a pixel art TD game, with maps that has two different types of tiles which I'm going to reefer as walkable tiles, and elevated tiles. It obviously has enemies, which are not original in any way, they vary in speed and HP and some have unoriginal abilities, such as temporary camouflage, turning into a horde of enemies upon dying and flying, I'm probably forgetting some abilities, but that just reinforce my point of them being unoriginal. The enemies are revealed on the beginning of the stage, like in PvZ, and they are weak or strong against certain types, and this is where the game start to brush over monster taming. The types are the typical natural elements, and some extra vulnerabilities or strengths against status changes, like slow or fear. 

Applying elemental damage or status changes can be done in two ways, first is by upgrading your "traps". The most important ones are the Boxes, Ballista, Cannon and the Spikes, you can have multiple traps of the same type at the same time, and some of them can be placed on the walkable tiles unlike the beasts. For example the ballista can be upgraded to a version that does fire damage or magic damage. The cannon can be upgraded to start dealing nature damage, the spikes can be upgraded to deal ice damage and apply slow. The traps also do a lot of damage resulting in some levels that can be beaten without even using the beasts or any abilities.
The boxes are the ones that caught my attention the most, just like the spikes they can be placed in the walkable tiles, and you can use them to alter the path of the enemy units, some levels can be beaten by abusing this mechanic, since not all of the enemies agro on the boxes, you can decide the pathing of the enemies.

After more than 300 words I'm finally talking about the Beasts, they can be placed on elevated tiles, they do one type of damage, and some apply status effects. They can be placed and upgraded using the Bean resource, they have 3 evolutions, and a special ability that can be activated manually and recharges a point after each wave. 
Their designs are also unoriginal, the nature beast is a cactus, the water beast is a frog, the electric beast is a thunder cloud, etc. They really did not bother themselves with coming up with new designs.

The last ways of dealing damage are using a unique ability that you get after beating the boss of each stage, and using the ability of your character and its ride, which can also be selected based on your preference in the "pre-match".

All of that being said, this game is a pretty good TD and I liked it. The gameplay is balanced, the harder stages actually require some strategy to win and there are some that I wasn't able to beat on the first try, that really made me want to beat the game, I rate the game a 7.5 out of 10.
However it does not belong in the monster taming genre. You "tame" the beasts by just completing a stage, that is not different from unlocking a new plant after a PvZ level. If you changed the sprites of the beats for the sprites of elemental mages, I would still rate it the same. That's just how disconnected this game is from monster taming.
